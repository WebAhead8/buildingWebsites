        <h1>About Us</h1>

        Railsware is a product studio. Since 2007, we have shaped our craft in product management, engineering, design, and marketing. Now, we apply it to both solutions for clients and our own products.
        Clients hire us to build and implement an entire product strategy, from the ground up. Among others, we have helped Calendly and BrightBytes turn from small startups into multi-million-dollar companies.
        Railsware products are the next step in company evolution. We have applied the best product development practices to create our own solutions. Today, Mailtrap and Smart Checklist for Jira have over 600K users and generate over $1M of annual recurring revenue.
        At Railsware Ideas Incubator, you can invent and develop new products within a creative ecosystem. A strong team of experts supports the product from idea to extensive growth.
        People feel great here. On average, a Railswarian stays in the company for around 6 years. We support our team with outstanding benefits and a remote working culture.
        Railswarians demand a lot of themselves first of all. We look for people with high potential who are ready to evolve in multiple directions. The right hires shape a team of A-players to learn from each other and evolve together.
